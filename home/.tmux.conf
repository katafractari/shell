# Faster Command Sequences
# Upon starting to use tmux, I noticed that I had to add a noticeable delay 
# between two characters in a command sequence for it to recognize the command,
# for example between the C-a and n in C-a n. This is because tmux is waiting 
# for an escape sequence. Fix that by setting escape time to zero.

# Aggressive Resize
# By default, all windows in a session are constrained to the size of the 
# smallest client connected to that session, even if both clients are looking 
# at different windows. It seems that in this particular case, Screen has the 
# better default where a window is only constrained in size if a smaller client 
# is actively looking at it. This behaviour can be fixed by setting tmux’s 
# aggressive-resize option.
